# Platform part 1: Base platform

First start with the base for your setup.

{{BOM}}

 
## Prepare the pillars {pagestep}

- Take four [pillar](framework.yml#RS25/M){Qty: 4}s and place in each one [headless M6 screw](framework.yml#SS6MS20){Qty: 4} at one end.

- Due to the length of the [headless M6 screw](framework.yml#SS6MS20)s place one [4mm post spacer](framework.yml#RS4M){Qty: 8} at the end of each screw.

- Now connect the two lower [10 cm x 30 cm breadboard](framework.yml#MB1030_M){Qty: 2}s with the pillars.
    - Screw in each breadboard two pillars, each on one short side of the board
    - Use a thread with one  offset inwards

- Attach to the other end of each pillar an [angle](framework.yml#C1515_M){Qty: 4} with the round clamp.
    - The flat side needs to point away from the breadboard


## Attach the upper breadbaord {pagestep}

- Place the upper [30 cm x 45 cm breadboard](framework.yml#MB3045_M){Qty: 1} on top of all angles
   - Use [M6 screws](screws.yml#m6_screws){Qty: 8} to fixate the upper breadboard
   - Ensure that the pillars can raise above the platform if you need to lower the height

You have now built the [base table]{output, qty:1}.

Version with only 2 pillars




## Alternative ground level

If you have an experimental setup of a table with threads and vibration decoupling, its recommened to use that instead of the lower breadboards. You need to check for thread and positional compatibility. 


## Optional: Less material

You can use only two pillars and place them diagonal to save some material with the cost of some stability.
This version is also used in the picture above.
