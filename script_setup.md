# Electronics part 2: Script initializing


Within this section you're going to upload the scripts to the [Arduino Uno](electronic.yml#Arduino_Uno) and BPod.


## Source of the code
https://github.com/open-make/code-texture-discrimination

## Matlab code {pagestep}

1. Install Matlab from the official website (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
2. Download the "Texture_dis" folder from the Github repository
3. Move the "Texture_dis" folder in the "bpod local/ protocol" folder of your Matlab installation





## Setup of the Arduino Uno {pagestep}

1. Install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Download the "texturedis" folder from the Github repository
4. Open "texturedis.ino" with the Arduino IDE
5. Connect the Arduino: Connect your Arduino board to your computer by using a USB cable.
6. Select the Arduino board and port: In the Arduino IDE, go to "Tools" > "Board" and select the appropriate Arduino board (e.g., "Arduino Uno"). Then, go to "Tools" > "Port" and select the port corresponding to your connected Arduino board.
7. Compile, check for errors and upload the code to your Arduino board.



## Saving of the output

While running the program in Matlab it saves
