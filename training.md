# Information about training

## Program for training

The Matlab script contains a trainings mode which can be used to habituate the mouse to the setup and train it on the task.

The trainings mode ignores the lick detection and provides rewards if the right texture was presented.

To activate the trainings mode change the "test_mode" variable in the variable window to "true".



>!! **Warning** 
>!!
>!! Adjust matlab script to have a top variable to activate trainingsmode
