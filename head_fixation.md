# Platform part 3: Head fixation 

For the observations the animal's head needs to be fixated above the center of the platform and therefore a head fixation method is required. This section is less detailed because you need to take your setup into account. Here we offer a solution which is basic and might work on your side. You can take this as an idea for the general basic structure if you design it yourself. In generell, we can recommend Thorlabs for ordering equipment.  



If no specific equipment is needed, a mount via the upper breadboards and some rods with angles is sufficient.
